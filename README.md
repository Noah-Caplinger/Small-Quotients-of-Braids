# Small-Quotients-of-Braids
This contains the computer code used to verify the non-existence of certain homomorphisms from braid groups. 

TotallySymmetricSets.sage contains all basic functions relating to totally symmetric sets.

HomomorphismCheckingAlgorithms.sage Contains the functions used to check whether certain homomorphisms $B_n, B_n' \to G$ can exist. 

The file TotallySymmetricSets.sage simply executes all homomorphism checks used in this paper. Run this file to reproduce these computations.
